         * If this bit is set (CMD=1) it indicates that the data in DB1 contains a command (query or a
         * response). This results in total 256 different commands.

         * DB1, not the actual CMD bit.

         * higher address range than the receiving node. This is not a problem if the receiving nodes that are
         * implementing this feature are capable to handle all the address range (i.e. 1-16 777 215). Another
         * solution is to assign all masters in the network (in a master/slave network) to the low address range
